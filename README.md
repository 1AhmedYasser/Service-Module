# Bürokratt's Service Module

Bürokratt's Service Module is a tool to help primarily product owners in collaboration with customer support agents/service managers to create, edit and otherwise manipulate Bürokratt's e-services via a graphical user interface. This includes setting up Ruuter- and Rasa-based user stories, making X-road / REST / database requests where and when appropriate and so forth.

Service Module focuses on the part of creation of any service where Bürokratt users can define service endpoints (i.e API or X-Road) whereas Training Module focuses on Rasa's side.
